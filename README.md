# awesomechat
A little project that I made for me and my friends like Discord.

## Work status
In development still, when it does release it will be invite-only until I can pay for a service like this and take it seriously (if I do.)
Detailed stuffs will be in the [blog.](https://blog.goawesome.chat)

## Compatibility
I am working hard to try to get this pushed out to web as of right now. After that I can start working on the iOS version and Android version.

## (Non) Frequently asked questions

### I can't log into this?
